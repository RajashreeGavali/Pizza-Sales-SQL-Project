# Pizza-Sales-SQL-Project

Welcome to the Pizza Sales SQL project! This repository hosts an end-to-end SQL project focused on analyzing pizza sales data. The project encompasses database creation, data querying, and deriving actionable insights from the dataset.

## About the Dataset
The data source is obtained from Kaggle.
The data is divided into 4 tables:

1.Order Details

2.Orders

3.Pizzas

4.Pizza types

The dataset utilized in this project pertains to the operations of a pizza company. The dataset is structured to facilitate comprehensive analysis, allowing us to extract valuable information regarding the company's performance, customer preferences, revenue trends, and more.

## Project Scope and Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to leverage SQL queries to explore, analyze, and derive insights from the provided pizza sales dataset. 
Key areas of focus include following things: 
- understanding sales trends
- identifying popular pizza types
- examining revenue generation patterns
- uncovering factors contributing to business success.
  
By systematically dissecting the dataset and conducting various SQL queries, we aim to extract actionable insights that can inform strategic decision-making and potentially drive business growth.

## Functions and Methods Used

- **Aggregation**: Count(), Sum(), Round(), Average(), Max()
- **String Manipulation**: UCASE()
- **Date & Time**: HOUR(), DAY(), DATE(), DAYNAME(), MONTH(), MONTHNAME()
- **Join Operations**: Joins
- **Grouping & Sorting**: Group by, Order by
- **Common Table Expressions (CTE)**
- **Aliases**
- **Subqueries**
- **Window Functions**: SUM(), DENSE_RANK()
- **Cumulative Sum**

## Insights & Recommendations:

1. **Promotions During Off-Peak Hours**: Offer special discounts or promotions during the period of reduced orders between 2pm to 5pm to incentivize customers to order during these times. This can help boost sales during slower periods.

2. **Focus on Best-Selling Pizza Types**: Given that the Classic Deluxe and Supreme pizzas are the most loved, consider introducing variations or promotions around these popular options to capitalize on customer preferences and drive sales further.

3. **Marketing Strategies for High and Low Revenue Pizzas**: Develop targeted marketing campaigns to promote high revenue-generating pizzas like The Thai Chicken Pizza and explore ways to enhance the appeal of lower-performing options like the Brie Carre Pizza to increase their sales.

4. **Optimize Order Size**: Since the average order quantity is around 2.3, consider offering bundle deals or upselling strategies to encourage customers to increase their order size, thus boosting revenue per transaction.

5. **Enhance Day-Specific Offers**: Given the slight variation in order counts on Wednesdays and Thursdays, tailor promotions or offers specifically for these days to attract more customers and potentially increase sales.

6. **Customer Engagement and Loyalty Programs**: Implement customer engagement initiatives such as loyalty programs, referral rewards, or personalized offers to foster repeat business and increase customer retention.

7. **Monitor and Adjust**: Continuously monitor sales trends, customer preferences, and feedback to identify areas for improvement and adjust strategies accordingly to stay competitive in the market.

By implementing these recommendations, we can optimize sales performance, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive overall business growth in the pizza sales domain.
